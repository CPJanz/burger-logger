# burger-logger

Burger Logger 9000 is a site which tracks burgers that are to be and those that have have been eaten. It was created as a class assignment focusing on the MVC design pattern, using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM to handle the MySQL queries.

## Usage

Users can add burgers to the to be eaten list by entering the burger name in the burger text field and submitting.

Burgers to be eaten can be moved to the already eaten list by clicking on the burger's corresponding 'Eat dat Burger!' button.

Data is backed by a MySQL server and persists between sessions.
